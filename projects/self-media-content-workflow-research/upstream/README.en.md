# Self Media Skills

[简体中文](README.md) | **English**

A modular, tool-agnostic suite of agent skills for social-media content operations: from a vague idea to a confirmed brief, account strategy, trend and competitor research, platform-native copy, short-video packages, optional digital-human production, WeChat draft publishing, performance reviews, and verified delivery — the full content loop.

- **Tool-agnostic** — no binding to a specific model, browser, image, video, publishing, or analytics service; capabilities are discovered from the running environment
- **Platform-native** — one topic shares facts and evidence, while titles, openings, structure, and calls to action are designed per platform
- **Human-in-the-loop** — five mandatory approval gates (direction, platforms, title, final copy, publishing); drafts and publishing packages by default, never automatic broadcasting
- **Evidence-first** — every key number needs a source; facts, opinions, inferences, and advice stay separated; no fabricated data, experience, or results
- **Systematic visuals** — eight built-in image-style presets with platform routing; a style is chosen before generation, one style per image set, and account preferences override preset defaults

For digital-human production, the user must personally upload and select likeness and voice assets in the chosen provider after reviewing its current data-processing terms. Task files, registries, and the repository must not store the original portrait or recording, their local paths, temporary links, or provider-private identifiers; they only index paths of deliverables such as generated clips, final videos, and caption files.

## Quick start

### Install

**Claude Code (recommended, no Node.js required)**

Run these two commands inside Claude Code to install all 9 skills at once:

```text
/plugin marketplace add yanhua1010/self-media-content-workflow
```

```text
/plugin install self-media-suite@self-media
```

**Other agents (Codex, Cursor, and more)**

Use the official [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) (requires Node.js):

```bash
# Install all 9 skills into the current project
npx skills add yanhua1010/self-media-content-workflow

# Install into the user-global skill directory
npx skills add yanhua1010/self-media-content-workflow -g
```

Install a subset with `--skill <name>`, and target specific agents with `-a`:

```bash
npx skills add yanhua1010/self-media-content-workflow --skill self-media-content-workflow -a claude-code
```

### First task

Start from the orchestrator; it routes to the modules it needs:

```text
Use $self-media-content-workflow to turn this product-failure story into an X thread and a Xiaohongshu carousel.
```

Modules can also be invoked directly:

```text
Use $self-media-content-strategy to build a topic pool and a one-month calendar for a new account.

Use $self-media-trend-radar to research the most-asked questions about AI coding content in the last month.

Use $self-media-content-analytics to review these 10 posts and identify the single next experiment.
```

> The exact skill-invocation syntax depends on your agent.

## Workflow

```text
Clarify → Direction approval* → Research & evidence → Platform approval* → Preflight
→ Platform-native draft → Title approval* → Assets (live-action / digital human) → Quality gates
→ Final-copy approval* → Publishing authorization* → Draft or publishing package → Review
```

`*` marks a mandatory human approval gate. Final-copy approval is not publishing authorization: skills create drafts or manual publishing packages by default and never broadcast.

Before assets are generated, the workflow recommends 2-3 styles from the [visual style library](skills/self-media-platform-copywriting/references/visual-styles.md) based on content type and platform, or reuses the account's established preference.

## Safety boundaries

- No automated competitor scraping with a creator's primary account session
- No automatic likes, comments, follows, DMs, or publishing
- No cookies, tokens, or secrets in task cards, logs, or the repository
- Digital-human portraits, likenesses, and voices must have confirmed usage rights; the user personally uploads and selects them in the chosen provider after reviewing its current data-processing terms
- No original portraits or recordings, their local paths, temporary links, or digital-human provider-private identifiers in task cards, content registries, or the repository — only index paths of deliverables such as generated clips, final videos, and captions; confirm the required AI/digital-human disclosures per target platform
- Stop immediately on CAPTCHAs, rate limits, or platform risk controls
- Verify recent products, prices, versions, and platform rules against official sources
- Never invent data, experience, revenue, user feedback, or test results

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full policy.

## Validation

```bash
python3 scripts/validate.py
```

The validator checks skill frontmatter, directory consistency, core-file length, UI metadata, relative links, and unresolved TODOs, with no third-party dependencies. CI runs the structural validation on every push and performs a real installation test with the official skills CLI.

## Repository layout

```text

├── <skill>/SKILL.md      #   core workflow (≤ 500 lines)
├── <skill>/references/   #   detailed platform guidance

.claude-plugin/           # Claude Code plugin and marketplace manifests
.github/workflows/        # structural validation + install test
```

## Design decisions

- One orchestrator owns routing and state; eight modules each own a single responsibility
- Collection and publishing are runtime adapter layers, never vendor-bound
- Platforms share facts and evidence while titles, openings, structure, and actions are rewritten per platform
- Platform limits change; exact values defer to official documentation or the publishing interface
